       <p>Hi There, Thanks for stopping by and checking out Marcel Clayton's page!
        I currently work as a Multimedia Producer, but I'm looking to move my career in the
        direction of Multimedia Interactive Designer. So, I enrolled in this program hoping
        to gain the necessary foundational skills that will help me launch the next phase of my career.</p>
